# Go-weather

### How it works
1. Make sure you have Go installed.
2. Clone the repo
3. Make sure you have the api key from https://openweathermap.org/
4. Create a `.env ` file and paste your api key in there.
5. Run on the command line `go run main.go`
6. Get the weather of your current city and put how you are feeling!

### Back End
Use any backend framework to build a weather app using the OpenWeatherMap API. Allow anonymous users to input their mood each day corresponding to the weather.
